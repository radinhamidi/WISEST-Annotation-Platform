## Overview
The WISEST Annotation Platform reduces the cognitive burden on researchers and health practitioners by automating systematic review quality appraisals. This tool ensures faster, more consistent assessments and supports evidence-based decision-making. It integrates advanced deep learning models to provide automated responses aligned with the ROBIS and AMSTAR-2 frameworks.

## Features
- Automated quality assessment for systematic reviews.
- Integration with ROBIS and AMSTAR-2 for evaluating SRs.
- User-friendly interface for technical and non-technical users.
- Facilitates systematic review annotation and evaluation in an organized manner.
- Open-source for easy customization and further development.

## Installation
